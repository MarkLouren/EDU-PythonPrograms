**Educational Programs in Python**
List of my programs in Python. 

**Classification:**
Number-Course-Lesson-Name.py

**Other:**
- I'll write in comments some important stuff for me. 
- Some Programs will be not from the courses so they instead of Course name I write "General".
- In many places code will be not clear and can be improved - I know this. The main task is to start to accomplish assignments but not to make a perfect code.
- I don't know how you'll find this repo, but if you think that some of the code is useful for your needs - welcome to use.

**Goals and Time:**
- My first goal is 100 programs. 

**Finished Courses**
- Udemy:The Python Bible: https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-YOZCKWTF/
- Coursera: Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
